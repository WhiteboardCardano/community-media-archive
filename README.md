# Cardano Community Media Archive

The **Cardano Community Media Archive** is an open-source initiative to preserve
and share design materials, media assets, and production files created for 
Cardano events worldwide.

This repository serves as a **structured index** of all event locations across 
multiple years. Each event folder contains:

- External download links  
- Metadata & previews  
- Credits  
- GitBook documentation references  

Raw files (GB–TB sized) are hosted externally for long-term access.

This archive exists to:

- Preserve Cardano’s creative history  
- Support educators, designers, and event organizers

## 🌐 Landing Pages (Visual Experience)

These pages are designed for general audiences, unlike GitHub which is a technical index.
