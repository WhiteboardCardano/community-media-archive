# Contributing to the Cardano Community Media Archive

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
This archive exists to preserve and share design, media, and production 
assets created for Cardano events worldwide.

To keep the archive structured, easy to navigate, and consistent, please follow 
the guidelines below before contributing.

## 🧱 1. Contribution Types

You may contribute:

### ✔ Event Assets (Links Only)
We do not store large files directly in the repository.  
Instead, you may contribute:
- Download links (Archive.org / MEGA / IPFS / etc.)
- Metadata describing the files
- Preview thumbnails
- Notes or documentation

### ✔ Metadata & Index Files
Under each event folder:
```
cardano-summit/<year>/<city-country>/
cardano-summit/<year>/<country-city>/
cardano-summit/<year>/<country>/
cardano-summit/<year>/<city>/
```
you may add:
- `index/` metadata files  
- Additional descriptive notes  
- Missing asset information  

### ✔ Previews
Small thumbnails (<500 KB) may be added to:
```
previews/
```

### ✔ Credits
If you contributed assets, add your name in:
```
credits.md
```

### ✔ Fixes & Maintenance
- Broken external links  
- Missing information  
- Folder cleanup  
- Naming corrections  
- New mirrors

## 🧭 2. Folder Structure Rules

All event assets must follow this structure:

```
cardano-summit/
  <year>/
    <city-country>/
      README.md
      links.md
      credits.md
      previews/
      index/
```

Examples:
```
cardano-summit/2023/vietnam-ho-chi-minh/
cardano-summit/2023/bali-indonesia/
cardano-summit/2024/manila-philippines/
```

Please do **not** create additional nested folders unless you are adding:

- `index/` → metadata  
- `previews/` → thumbnails  
- `concepts/` → (only if multiple design concepts are needed)

---

## 📝 3. File Naming Conventions

Use:

```
<year>-<city>-<category>-<asset-name>-v<version>.<format>
```

Examples:
```
2023-hcmc-social-frame-main-v1.psd
2023-bali-stage-loop-01-v2.mp4
2024-manila-logo-pack-v1.zip
```

## 📦 4. Adding Download Links

Place all links inside `links.md`:

```
## Asset Pack Name
- Type: (Graphics / Motion / Export / etc.)
- Download: <URL>
- Notes: (optional)
```

---

## 🖼 5. Adding Previews

Add thumbnails to:

```
previews/
```

Use filenames like:

```
